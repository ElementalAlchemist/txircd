This document describes all of the oper permissions used by the modules of
txircd. These permissions are important, as an oper with no permissions in
their oper block is effectively a normal user with no extra rights. This
document is divided in two sections: core permissions, that come with the core
modules and extra permissions, that come with the extra modules that can be
loaded.
