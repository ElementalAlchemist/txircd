======

txircd is a modular IRC daemon written in Python using the Twisted library.

For installation instructions, see the INSTALL file.

By default, txircd supplies all of the required functionality for a basic,
RFC-compliant IRC server. When you configure the server, you can add additional
functionality to make the server work how you want it to.

If you find any bugs or have any questions about txircd, please talk to us in
\#dev at irc.dbcommunity.org.
