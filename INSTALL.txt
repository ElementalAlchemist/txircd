How to install


Option 1 - Install to System

Run:
    sudo ./install
This will install txircd to default locations on the filesystem,
and register it as an upstart service. Python dependencies get installed into a virtualenv.

This script assumes that python2, pip and virtualenv are installed,
and an ubuntu-like system.

The config file will be placed in /etc/txircd.yaml
The server will log to /var/log/upstart/txircd.log
The server process will run as unprivliged user "txircd"

You may change these options by editing the variables at the top of the file.

Once the service is installed, it will start on boot, and you can control it with
    sudo service txircd (start|stop|status)


Option 2 - Manual

The following steps can be done either directly to the system or in a virtualenv

Install dependencies:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

Create a config file in the current directory:
    edit txircd.yaml

Run txircd in the foreground:
    twistd -n txircd
or allow it to daemonise:
    twistd txircd
