How to install


Option 1 - Install to System

Run:
    sudo ./install.upstart
or:
    sudo ./install.systemd
(pick whichever is appropriate for your system)

This will install txircd to default locations on the filesystem,
and register it as a service. Python dependencies get installed into a virtualenv.

This script assumes that python2, pip and virtualenv are installed.

The config file will be placed in /etc/txircd.yaml
The server will log to /var/log/upstart/txircd.log (on upstart)
or to the systemd journal (on systemd)
The server process will run as unprivliged user "txircd"

You may change some of these options by editing the variables at the top of the file.

Once the service is installed, it will start on boot, and you can control it with:
on upstart:
    sudo service txircd (start|stop|status)
on systemd:
    sudo systemctl (start|stop|status) txircd


Option 2 - Manual

The following steps can be done either directly to the system or in a virtualenv

Install dependencies:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

Create a config file in the current directory:
    edit txircd.yaml

Run txircd in the foreground:
    twistd -n txircd
or allow it to daemonise:
    twistd txircd
