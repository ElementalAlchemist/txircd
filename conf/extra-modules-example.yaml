# txircd Configuration - Extra Modules

# This file has lots of stuff for all of our extra, optional modules.
# Everything is off by default, but feel free to configure it as you see fit.

# If the config loader complains about this line when you start the server and
# you didn't load any modules from this file, maybe just don't include this
# file. (Go back to the bottom of txircd.yaml for that.)
modules:

# AutoJoin: Makes users automatically join some channels on connect. This is
# useful in certain circumstances, but we don't recommend enabling this for
# most networks, as outside of certain contexts, most users will find it
# annoying. Requires some configuration to fully function (see below).
#- AutoJoin

# AutoUserModes: Automatically applies user modes to users on connect. This
# module requires some configuration to fully function (see below).
#- AutoUserModes

# BlockChannelNotices: Provides a channel mode (+T) that blocks sending NOTICE
# commands to that channel.
#- BlockChannelNotices

# BlockColors: Provides a channel mode (+c) that blocks the use of formatting
# in the channel.
#- BlockColors

# BlockCTCP: Provides a channel mode (+C) that blocks the use of CTCPs except
# ACTION to that channel.
#- BlockCTCP

# Censor: Allows setting a global censor list using the CENSOR command. The
# censor list will be enforced on channels or on private messages to users with
# the +G mode set.
# The command works as follows:
# /censor <badword> <replacement>
# where <badword> is a regex representing the text you want to censor, and
# <replacement> is the text with which you want to replace it.
#- Censor

# ChannelFlood: Provides a channel mode (+f) to limit the rate at which
# messages can be sent to a channel by a user.
#- ChannelFlood

# ChannelOpAccess: Provides fine control over which levels of op can do what in
# a channel with the +W mode. The default permission for an action (usually +o
# for most op-only actions) can be set using +W rank:permissionName, where
# "rank" is the minimum required status mode (e.g. 'o' or 'v'), and
# "permissionName" is the name of the permission to allow/restrict to that
# level.
#- ChannelOpAccess

# ConnectionLimit: Provides a way to limit the maximum number of connections
# from a single host. This module has some optional configuration (see below).
# We highly recommend loading it.
#- ConnectionLimit

# CustomPrefix: Provides a way to specify custom channel ranks for channels.
# This is the way to get additional ranks beyond +ov. This module has some
# optional configuration (see below). If it's not configured, we provide
# owner (+q, ~), admin (+a, &), and halfop (+h, %) modes by default.
#- CustomPrefix

# DCCBlock: Blocks DCC from being initiated on this server.
#- DCCBlock

# DenyChannels: Prevents some channels from being used at all server-wide.
# Opers with the channel-denied permission can still join and use channels that
# are denied. This module requires some configuration (see below).
#- DenyChannels

# GlobalLoad: Provides a way to load or unload a module on all servers all at
# once.
#- GlobalLoad

# Globops: Provides a way for an oper to send a message to all other opers.
# The GLOBOPS command can be used by opers with the command-globops permission,
# and the the message will be sent to all opers with the view-globops
# permission.
#- Globops

# HostCloaking: Provides the +x user mode allowing users to cloak their
# hostnames. This module requires some configuration (see below). If you want
# to encourage cloaking for your users (you probably do), we also recommend
# adding mode 'x' to your AutoUserModes configuration.
#- HostCloaking

# Knock: Allows users to KNOCK on an invite-only channel. Also provides the
# channel mode +K to disallow knocking on a channel.
#- Knock

# ModulesCommand: Provides a command that lists all modules loaded on the
# server.
#- ModulesCommand

# RateLimit: Allows limiting the rate at which commands are sent to the server.
# This can help to prevent most severe flooding from small numbers of users.
# This module has some optional configuration (see below).
#- RateLimit

# SajoinCommand: Provides the SAJOIN command, allowing opers with the
# command-sajoin permission to join users to channels.
#- SajoinCommand

# SakickCommand: Provides the SAKICK command, allowing opers with the
# command-sakick permission to kick users from channels.
#- SakickCommand

# SamodeCommand: Provides the SAMODE command, allowing opers with the
# command-samode permission to set modes on other users or channels.
#- SamodeCommand

# SanickCommand: Provides the SANICK command, allowing opers with the
# command-sanick permission to change the nicknames of other users.
#- SanickCommand

# SapartCommand: Provides the SAPART command, allowing opers with the
# command-sapart permission to forcibly part users from channels.
#- SapartCommand

# SatopicCommand: Provides the SATOPIC command, allowing opers with the
# command-satopic permission to set the topics of channels.
#- SatopicCommand

# Shun: Provides the SHUN command, which allows opers with the command-shun
# permission to restrict users to a small subset of commands. This module has
# some optional configuration (see below).
#- Shun

# ServerNoticeConnect: Provides the "connect" server notice type which notifies
# opers of user connections.
#- ServerNoticeConnect

# ServerNoticeOper: Provides the "oper" server notice type which notifies opers
# of successful and failed oper attempts.
#- ServerNoticeOper

# ServerNoticeQuit: Provides the "quit" server notice type which notifies opers
# of user disconnections.
#- ServerNoticeQuit

# ServerNoticeRemoteConnect: Provides the "remoteconnect" server notice type
# which notifies opers of user connections on remote servers.
#- ServerNoticeRemoteConnect

# ServerNoticeRemoteQuit: Provides the "remotequit" server notice type which
# notifies opers of user disconnections on remote servers.
#- ServerNoticeRemoteQuit

# StatsOnlineOpers: Provides the onlineopers STATS type, which lists all opers
# that are currently online.
#- StatsOnlineOpers

# StatsPorts: Provides the ports STATS type, which lists all client and server
# ports the server is currently listening on.
#- StatsPorts

# StatsUptime: Provides the uptime STATS type, which shows how long the server
# has been running for.
#- StatsUptime

# StripColors: Provides a channel mode (+S) that strips formatting from
# messages sent to the channel.
#- StripColors


# AutoJoin Configuration
# Configuring this module requires specifying which channels to have the user
# automatically join on connect. Users will not be joined to channels to which
# they do not have permission to join.
#client_join_on_connect:
#- '#welcome'
#- '#newusers'

# AutoUserModes Configuration
# Configuring this module requires specifying which modes are set automatically
# on connect. You can specify modes with parameters the way you normally
# would--by separating them with spaces.
#client_umodes_on_connect: x

# ConnectionLimit Configuration
# This module has two options to set up, the maximum connections per host and
# IP addresses that can bypass the connection limit.

# connlimit_globmax
# This setting determines the maximum number of connections allowed from a
# single host on the entire network. The default value is 3.
#connlimit_globmax: 3

# connlimit_whitelist
# This setting is a list of IP addresses which are exempt from the connection
# limit specified in connlimit_globmax. By default, there are no exempt hosts.
#connlimit_whitelist: []

# CustomPrefix Configuration
# Configuring this module simply requires specifying all of the custom status
# modes you want to have on your network. It's important that you know what
# other modes are used on your network and not to reuse any of those mode
# letters here, since otherwise you'll likely break things. By default, this
# module makes halfop (+h, %), admin (+a, &), and owner (+q, ~) modes like
# this:
#custom_prefixes:
#  h:
#    level: 50
#    char: '%'
#  a:
#    level: 150
#    char: '&'
#  q:
#    level: 200
#    char: '~'

# DenyChannels Configuration
# Configuring this module involves specifying which channels you don't want to
# allow.

# deny_channels
# This is a list of channel names which are not allowed to be used on this
# server. Wildcards (* and ?) may be used.
#deny_channels:
#- '#bad_channel'
#- '#evil*'

# allow_channels
# This is a list of channel names which are exempt from the deny_channels list.
# This is useful for if you have specific channels that you want to allow, but
# they match wildcards in your deny_channels list. This list also accepts
# wildcards. If a channel matches names or wildcards in both lists,
# allow_channels will always override deny_channels.
#allow_channels:
#- '#evil_overlords'

# HostCloaking Configuration
# This module has some required configuration and some optional configuration.

# cloaking_salt
# This is REQUIRED for cloaking to work properly. Otherwise, host cloaks will
# NOT be secure and can easily be reversed by malicious users!
# This can be any string you like, but make sure it's reasonably long and
# random (include symbols and other things). It doesn't matter exactly what the
# string is as long as it's very likely to be reasonably unique for your
# network.
# Changing this string will change the resulting cloaks, which is likely to
# break existing ban masks using cloaked hosts, so consider carefully before
# changing it, and announce to your users that you're doing so.
# For security, don't use the default value I put below. Change it to something
# else as you uncomment it.
#cloaking_salt: secret

# cloaking_prefix
# You may also specify an optional prefix that is placed before cloaked hosts.
#cloaking_prefix: txircd

# Knock Configuration
# This module has some optional configuration.

# knock_delay
# The amount of time (in seconds) after knocking a user must wait before
# knocking again. The default value is 5 minutes (300 seconds).
#knock_delay: 300

# RateLimit Configuration
# Configuring this module involves tweaking the parameters for the maximum
# command rate.

# rate_interval
# Specify the number of seconds to use for the amount of time in which the
# specified number of commands can be sent. The default value is 60 seconds.
#rate_interval: 60

# rate_soft_limit
# This is the number of commands that can be run every rate_interval seconds.
# If this is exceeded, the user will be warned, and commands from that user
# (except PING and PONG) will be ignored. The default value is 60 commands.
#rate_soft_limit: 60

# rate_kill_limit
# If a user reaches this number of commands in rate_interval seconds, the user
# will be disconnected. The default value is 500 seconds.
#rate_kill_limit: 500

# Shun
# For this module, you can specify the commands that are able to be sent by a
# SHUNned user. By default, users may send JOIN, PART, QUIT, PING, and PONG.
# We strongly recommend not removing PING or PONG from the list of allowed
# commands.
#shun_commands:
#- JOIN
#- PART
#- QUIT
#- PING
#- PONG
