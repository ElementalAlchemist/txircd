# txircd Configuration - Services for Desert Bus

# These modules depend on a number of base account modules, including Accounts
# and many modules that expose commands to allow users to interface with
# accounts. See the services example configuration for more information.
# For the Desert Bus setup in particular to work properly, we recommend
# disabling the REGISTER and DROP commands but keeping the others enabled.

modules:

# DBDonorDatabase: This module serves as a single point through which other
# donor-account-based modules can access the database. The donor_db setup
# (below) must be set up in order for this module to function.
- DBDonorDatabase

# DBDonorAccount: This module ties Desert Bus donor accounts into the standard
# account system. With this, users can log into Desert Bus donor accounts as
# their accounts here. This module requires either DBDonorDatabase to be loaded
# or donor_linked_server (below) to be specified in order to function.
- DBDonorAccount

# donor_db
# Information for connecting to the database. The database must already have
# the correct schema set up. The value is a dict of information for connecting;
# required keys are "host", "port", "database", "user", and "password". The
# default value is no information.
#donor_db:
#  host: localhost
#  port: 3306
#  database: txircd
#  user: txircd
#  password: txircd

# donor_linked_server
# If this server isn't connected to the database but another server is, you can
# specify a server name for donor_linked_server. Accessing donor account
# information in the database will go to the specified server. That server must
# have donor_db specified with a connection to the database server. The default
# value is not specified.
#donor_linked_server: otherserver.example.com
