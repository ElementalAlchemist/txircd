# txircd Configuration - Services for Desert Bus

# These modules depend on a number of base account modules, including Accounts
# and many modules that expose commands to allow users to interface with
# accounts. See the services example configuration for more information.
# For the Desert Bus setup in particular to work properly, we recommend
# disabling the REGISTER and DROP commands but keeping the others enabled.

modules:

# DBDonorDatabase: This module serves as a single point through which other
# donor-account-based modules can access the database. The donor_db setup
# (below) must be set up in order for this module to function.
- DBDonorDatabase

# DBDonorAccount: This module ties Desert Bus donor accounts into the standard
# account system. With this, users can log into Desert Bus donor accounts as
# their accounts here. This module requires either DBDonorDatabase to be loaded
# or donor_linked_server (below) to be specified in order to function.
- DBDonorAccount

# BidService: This module provides the utilities required to have a bidding
# service which handles running auctions and users bidding.
- BidService

# donor_db
# Information for connecting to the database. The database must already have
# the correct schema set up. The value is a dict of information for connecting;
# required keys are "host", "port", "database", "user", and "password". The
# default value is no information.
#donor_db:
#  host: localhost
#  port: 3306
#  database: txircd
#  user: txircd
#  password: txircd

# donor_linked_server
# If this server isn't connected to the database but another server is, you can
# specify a server name for donor_linked_server. Accessing donor account
# information in the database will go to the specified server. That server must
# have donor_db specified with a connection to the database server. The default
# value is not specified.
#donor_linked_server: otherserver.example.com

# bid_announce_bot
# If you've set up ServerBots and want bid messages to appear as coming from
# that bot, you can put the nick of one of those bots here.
# Be careful: If the server bot isn't set up and someone assumes this nickname,
# messages will appear to come from that user!
# By default, messages are sent as coming from the server.
#bid_announce_bot: BidServ

# bid_announce_channels
# A list of channels to which to send the bid announcements. There are no
# channels in this list by default, so unless you want it to be a silent
# auction, make sure to add some!
#bid_announce_channels:
#- '#desertbus'

# bid_minimum_increment
# The smallest allowed increment over the lowest winning bid for a new high bid
# to be accepted. The default value is 0.01.
#bid_minimum_increment: '5.00'

# bid_going_cooldown
# The number of seconds it must be after the last submitted bid before the
# auction can go once. The default value is 0.
#bid_going_cooldown: 5

# bid_log_directory
# The directory in which to save auction logs. If not specified, auction logs
# are not saved.
#bid_log_directory: auction-logs/
